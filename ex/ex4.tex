\exercise{Esercizio 4}
{Let $\langle C, \leq_C \rangle$ be a complete lattice and let $S \subseteq C$ be a subset of $C$ which is meet-closed, that is:
$$
\forall Y \subseteq S. \wedge_C Y \in S
$$
Prove that $\langle S, \leq_C\rangle$ can be viewed as an abstract domain of $C$ where the concretization map 
$\gamma : S \to C$ is the identity.
